# IRB-Robo-Arm
*aka Image Recognition Based Robotic Arm

This repo contains the arduino and AI(machine learning) codes that we used in our above mentioned project for LOCUS 2020.
It was a thematic project under UN's SDG #3 - Good Health and Well-Being. 



Members of the project were:
1. Akanksha Giri (076BEI004)
2. Anju Chhetri (076BEI005)
3. Devraj Parajuli (076BEI013)
4. Dikshya Parajuli (076BEI041)
5. Prajwol Pradhan (076BEI023)
6. [Sumit Yadav](https://github.com/rockerritesh) (076BCT088)

The project had three different aspects, according to which the team was divided: 

  -> Hardware aspect         | 3D printed hand, support for the hand (arm)
  
  -> Arduino aspect          | Code for controlling the actuation of motors, based on the data sent by the ML algorithm
  
  -> Machine Learning aspect | Code for detecting what it was trained for, based on the datasets taken during the training.
